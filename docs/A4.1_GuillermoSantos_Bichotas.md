## Development
1. Use the following list of materials for the preparation of the activity

    |quantity|Description|
    |---|---|
    |1|[L293D][L293D]
    |1|[NodeMCU ESP32][ESP32]|
    |1|[5V voltage source][voltage source]|
    |1|[Jumpers][Jumpers]|
    |1|[Protoboard][Protoboard]|
2. Based on the images shown in Figure 1, assemble the circuit into a single circuit
devises such a way that you can obtain a system capable of complying with the instructions
previously requested for this activity.

    * By means of the application "Serial Bluetooth terminal" that   can be downloaded from the play Store of
    google or even any other that it considers, you must control the start and shutdown of an engine
    DC, that is to say there will be two petitions, one of which will represent the "START" and the other option
    "STOP"
    * The engine should be able to turn in favor of the hands of the clock for 5 seconds, when that is fulfilled
    time should slow down 1 second and reverse your turn for another 5 seconds.

## Conclusions
>**Kathy Ramos:** This practice was an example of what can be achieved by establishing a Bluetooth connection with the esp32 and using a platform other than Aurduino for the inputs of the instructions for the motor. Thanks to these inputs sent from this platform it is possible to make the motor start to turn and stop when when user indicates it, the biggest difficulty was to make it stop with an interruption so that there was an immediate response.
 

>**Guillermo Santos:** For this practice it was necessary to establish a bluetooth connection from the mobile to the esp32 to control the circuit, this, and depending on what you send as a signal will perform an instruction that will move, in this case we have the 2 instructions, the instruction START, that this what it does is to start the circuit and activate the motor that was connected which will rotate for 5 seconds from there have a 1 second braking and reverse the direction of rotation motor, this will be repeated indefinitely until the second instruction, which is the STOP, this what it will do is stop the operation of the circuit.
 

>**Jose Aguilar:** In this practice we have managed to appreciate another of the functionalities of the ESP32 component, which is Bluetooth. For this circuit we have connected a motor of which through a mobile application we can change its behavior, turn clockwise or in the opposite direction even stop. It is interesting the variety of components and applications that we can make as students.

>**David Becerra:** It was a real challenge to interrupt the movement of the motor because at first we investigated about the interrupts that the esp32 module handles internally, but after searching for a long time, we came to the conclusion that it would be more feasible to make a logical interrupt within the code, since the interrupt that handles esp32 asks for a signal to be detected on any of the pins.
