2. Once the previous circuit is assembled, perform a program that allows the assembly to comply with the
conditions:
    * The system must be able to turn an LED on and off when pressing the touch sensor.
    * The system must have the characteristic that if the Led is on, when touching the touch sensor, it will initiate a 3-second flashing sequence (i.e. it shuts down for 1 second, turns on for a second and finally turns off).
    * The system must have the characteristic that if the Led is off when touching the sensor
    touch, this will turn on little by little until it reaches its maximum level of illumination.

3. Place here evidence that you consider important during the development of the activity.

        When we tried to load the code to the board, the IDE threw the error, which is due to connection problems, so the expected results could not be observed. One of the solutions that was tried to implement was to hold down the BOOT and FLASH buttons on the board, but this did not solve the problem. The necessary drivers for the correct functioning of the ports were also reinstalled, but in the same way it was not solved.

4. Conclusion  
    >**Jose Aguilar:** For the development of this practice, the team had problems since the drivers of the esp32 were not detected correctly in the arduino IDE. Fortunately we were able to observe the behavior of the circuit thanks to the presentations of the other teams. The ESP32 component has different functionalities one of them is to work with touch. In this practice we make a touch sensor in which at the time of touching the pin corresponding to the touch we can turn on the LED and once on if we touch the pin again the LED will turn off. additionally more features were added, such as when the led is off and volvemos to turn on, the led prendera slowly until reaching the maximum

    >**David Becerra:** The integrated esp32 is a module very similar to arduino, in the current practice we made a capacitive touch sensor that detects if an aluminum panel is touched, if the panel is not touched it will not detect anything. It is a pity that in the end, the computer could not detect the ESP32 module in the communications port, it was even tried on a laptop with linux and it did not detect it either, not even after installing the corresponding drivers, that is why we have asked for help from a classmate to lend us an ESP32 module.


    >**Kathy Ramos** In general, the realization of the practice was not very difficult, it was very supportive that there is a lot of documentation on ESP32, which I think helped a lot mainly in the development of the code and the whole development was quite interesting because it is the first time that I worked with a non-Arduino board, and the fact that you can use that IDE is convenient if you are already familiar with it. The fact that there were connection problems did not allow us to appreciate the operation of the circuit, but now that we know the reason for the error, we will be able to solve it or avoid them in future practices. 

    >**Guillermo Santos** The esp32 module is a very interesting device because in addition to containing the functions of wifi and bluetooth, it is able to connect to various peripherals. Basically in this practice was intended to configure the esp32 module using the code that makes the led can turn on slowly, and make an intermittent signal, which made the led blink. In our case, it was not possible for the computer to recognize the esp32 module, it is believed that it was due to the drivers or that the module was generic and presented problems.
