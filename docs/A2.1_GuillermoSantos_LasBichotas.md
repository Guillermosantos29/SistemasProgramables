### INTRODUCTION
The AR-DCMOTOR model is a direct current geared motor designed to be used in integrated applications that require motion, such as mobile vehicles, robots and special projects.  
Gearmotors are widely used today and can range from a small gearmotor capable of changing and combining rotational speeds in a wristwatch, changing speeds in an automobile, to huge gearmotors capable of providing traction in cargo ships, cement mills, large tunnel boring machines or sugar cane mills. 

### DEFINITION
It is ideal for projects such as a line follower robot. Since this gear motor is small in appearance, however, it has a torque of 0.8 kg which makes it strong enough to move a robot or the project being developed without sacrificing speed.     
Our gear motor can be powered from 3 to 6 Vdc, by controlling the voltage supplied it is possible to control the speed to be developed.     
The torque is the maximum rotational force that the shaft can generate at the output of the gearmotor. This turning force is expressed in different units: : kilograms/meter, pounds/foot, pounds/inch, Newton/meter, etc.

### EXPLAIN THE PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION.
A geared motor has a motor directly coupled to a gearing system, this allows the motor to reduce or increase its speed depending on the configuration of the gears used. This geared motor is designed with a double shaft and a reduction factor of 1:48, ideal for robotic applications. The shaft is flat and has a 1.9mm inner bore, compatible with 2mm car shafts.  

### APLICATIONS

- mobile vehicles 
- robots
- changing and combining rotational speeds in a wristwatch
- changing speeds in an automobile
- traction on cargo ships
- excavating machines
- cane mills

### CONCLUSIONS

- **Jose Aguilar**: Electric actuators have very diverse applications, and we can appreciate their operation with the geared motors that are implemented in various projects.

- **David Becerra**: It is a very useful tool in school electronics and robotics projects. It is ideal in projects where you need to turn a pulley, a gear or a wheel for a robot.

- **Guillermo Santos**: The dual-axis geared motor is an electronic device designed for robots such as line follower robots or simply mobile vehicles, it has the ability to increase or decrease its speed depending on the case it is necessary. This device can be useful in different areas such as agriculture.

- **Kathy Ramos**: This motor model is one of the most practical and common to use for any project, especially in small and simple projects such as some school projects or basic electronics. Its application in circuits is simple and its operation is not difficult to understand so it is possible to give multiple uses.
