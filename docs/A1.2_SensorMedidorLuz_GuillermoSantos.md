2. Considering that the LDR element is a photo resistive sensor, i.e. its resistance varies according to the amount of light hitting it, **what do you see in the graph below?**

    **Answer:** When the LDR component recive ilumination, the resistence  of component less slowly. In this example the ilumination is natural (Sun)

6. Calculate the theoretical Vout voltage value for each of the conditions.

7. Measure the measured Vout voltage value for each of the conditions.

8. Calculate the voltage accuracy value between theoretical and measured for each condition, consider including in this section explaining how the theoretical calculations were obtained.


    |Condition|Photoresistor impedance|Theoretical Vout voltage| Measured Vout voltage|% Measured / Theoretical|
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    |No light|180 kΩ|1000/(1000 + 180000) * 5V = **0.02762V** | **27.7mV**|**99.78%**|
    |Ambient light|912 Ω|1000/(1000 + 912) * 5V = **2.615V**|**2.61V**|**99.8%**|
    |Intensive light|506 Ω|1000/(506+1000) * 5V = **3.32V**| **3.32V**|**100%**|

9. Make a graph using the values recorded in the table above, where the "X" axis is the measured Vout Voltage and the "Y" axis represents the impedance at the LDR photoresistor, and insert the graph.

11. Include individual conclusions and results observed during the development of the activity.

    **José Aguilar:**  
    I can look LDR behaviour when it recive ilumination, this allows me to have an idea of how some lamps work when they turn on by themselves at night.

    **David Becerra:**  
    I found that it is not so complicated to understand how the LDR works, the more light, the lower the resistance and the higher the voltage.

    **Guillermo Santos:**  
    In this work we were able to observe the functionality of a photoresistor in a circuit while it was powered by a 5 volt power supply and an extra 1K ohm resistor. Regarding the operation of the photoresistor, it depends on the amount of light it receives, in this case we work with 3 conditions, absence of light, ambient light and intense light, its behavior was that the more light the more the amount of resistance decreased.

    **Kathy Ramos:**  
    Thanks to the practice I learned how the sensor works and to observe the changes in values of the resistance when there are changes in the light conditions and it was interesting to me because I had not used the sensor before and thanks to that now I can understand as it is applied in its common use such as garden lamps. I was also able to reinforce my little knowledge of electronics thanks to the circuit
