# :trophy: A5.1 learnig activity
* Sensor system and color action of an object, and visual interface
---
## Instructions
* Perform a color identification system using a TCS34725 RGB sensor, a nodeMCU
ESP32, an SG90 Servomotor actuator, any communication protocol and a visual interface that
it can be developed by the team or supported by others such as Node-network for example.

2. Based on the images shown in Figure 1, make a system capable of meeting the
following conditions:
    * The first phase of the activity will consist of, when placing an object in front of the RGB sensor, this must
    identify what color it has (it is advisable to use red, green, and blue objects for
    greater precision), which should show in a visual interface what color was detected.
    * The second phase, will consist of adding an actuator that and a color identifier supporting
    of a band of colors as shown in Image 1; knowing the color of the object the
    actuator should point to the color that is being detected.

6. For the demonstration of the activity, more than one object must be used to cover at least three
colors.

## Conclusions
>**Kathy Ramos:** Personally I thought that this practice would be one of the most difficult in terms of programming, but once doing it we saw that it was really simpler than expected, obviously it made it much easier to find information about the interface, since we used Node-Red and the most important thing for all the development of the practice was to use the corresponding libraries. It is important to note that once the code is executed, it can be seen that when you want to detect a color that is not red, green or blue, the values of the sensor will indicate the color that most resembles one of these three and this is the one that will indicate the servomotr.


>**Guillermo Santos:** In this practice, the programming of the circuit was a little shorter than in other occasions, what was done in this practice was to program a circuit including the RGB Sensor component, what it did was to detect the color of the object and due to its programming, it recognized it and showed it in console giving the name of its color. The difficult part of the practice was to use Node Red, which we used to make a graphical interface where it was detecting that color took the rgb sensor and indicate it in that graphical interface, in our case we used colored pen caps, so that the rgb sensor would detect it. As for the use of the servomotor, it was activated and indicated which color had been detected.



>**Jose Aguilar:** In this practice we were able to observe the operation of our RGB color sensor TCS34725, we detected the color of three different objects which are expected to be red, blue or green. Additionally, we use a Node-RED server to achieve communication between the sensor and a graphical interface so that we can observe the changes that occur. Like the previous practices it is difficult to work as a team in terms of assembling the circuit since only one person is in charge of that however we have managed to maintain good communication via text and also by video calls

>**David Becerra:** This practice was especially challenging, first, because we did not know at the beginning how the RGB sensor works, since the guides do not show which pins are needed to operate the sensor and how to read the values. Once we crossed that hurdle, we had to find the right library for the servomotor. But nothing was more challenging for us than the Node-Red interface. Our problem with the interface was that we didn't know how to interface the ESP32 module to Node-Red. Finally we were able to find some material on the internet for the interface.
