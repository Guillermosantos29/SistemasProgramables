1. Use the electronic circuit in the image below and assemble stage 1 inside the simulator.

2. As you can see in the previous circuit there is an area identified as "Time Network" and another "Decoupling Filter", explain the purpose of both terminologies.

    >**Time Network:**
    >It is a stage at which the pulse train is determined, which shows us the pulse time in a high and low state

    >**Thecoupling filter:**
    >It is a stage in which a capacitor is used to decouple (separate) AC signals from a DC signal

    

3. Continuing with the previous image, note the equation Ct= 1.1 * R1 * C1, which is used to establish the on-time of the output pulse. Based on that equation above calculate the values of R1 and C1 if you want to keep the output pulse on, given the 3 conditions required in the attached table.

        Ct = 1.1 * R1 * C1
        
        Condition 1
        3 = 1.1 * 1.2MΩ * 2.2μF
        3 s ≈ 2.904 s

        Condition 2
        5 = 1.1 * 1.5MΩ * 3.3μF
        5 s ≈ 5.445 s

        Condition 3
        8 = 1.1 * 2.2MΩ * 3.3μF
        8 ≈ 7.986 s


    | Number | Condition | R1 Value| C1 Value |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | 1 | 3 seconds | 1.2MΩ | 2.2μF |
    | 2 | 5 seconds | 1.5MΩ | 3.3μF |
    | 3 | 8 seconds | 2.2MΩ | 3.3μF |

    

4. Once the above table is completed, start the simulation for any of the three conditions and observe the behavior of the LED; explain your observation.

    > When the simulation is started, the LED lights up for about 3 seconds, after 3 seconds the LED turns off, if the push button is pressed the LED lights up again for another 3 seconds.

5. Assemble stage 2 and integrate the output pulse terminal to the transistor base input of this second stage.

6. Upon completion of the previous step, choose one of the 3 conditions recorded in the table above and observe the behavior of the DC motor; explain your observation.

    > Like the led, the motor turns on and stays on for approximately 3 seconds, after 3 seconds the motor stops, if the push button is pressed the motor turns on again for another 3 seconds.

7. Once the on-time of the stage 1 output pulse is complete, what happens to the DC motor? Explain the reason for this behavior

    > Once the output pulse is completed, the motor shuts down, this is because as long as the transistor does not receive a signal at the base, it will not allow current to flow in the motor.

### CONCLUSIONS

- **Jose Aguilar**:  In this practice we were able to observe the behavior of the LM555 component according to its application in the circuit made, it is interesting to know the theory of the component and its performance in practice.
- **David Becerra**: The practice was interesting, the timer practically deactivates the circuit during certain time intervals. This is useful if we want the circuit to be activated for a while and then deactivated, such as a buzzer or the motor of a printer.
- **Kathy Ramos**: In this practice we were able to appreciate the behavior of the timer, both in the response of the Led and in the motor, and it was interesting since it was the first practice in which we could observe the behavior of the signal that is sent to the Trigger terminal of the timer

The LM555 circuit is an interesting electronic device, since its function is based on a timer, which you can manipulate its time intervals by adding more resistance to its components. The calculation of the timer time, resistance and capacitors can be done by the formula: Ct = 1.1 * R * C. This can have applications such as in alarms, servo motor control, detectors, etc.
