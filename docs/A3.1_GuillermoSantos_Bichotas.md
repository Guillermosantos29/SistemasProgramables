3. Considering that the ultrasonic sensor has a minimum and maximum detection range based on the
sound signal return time, which values are obtained in the simulation under the following
conditions:

    number|Condition 1|Condition 2|Is the object detected?
    ---|---|---|---|
    1|5 cm away from the sensor|0 degrees to the perpendicular axis of the sensor|Yes
    2|50 cm away from the sensor|35 degrees to the perpendicular axis of the sensor|No
    3|100 cm away from the sensor|-35 degrees to the perpendicular axis of the sensor|No
    4|5 cm away from the sensor|90 degrees to the perpendicular axis of the sensor|Yes
    5|50 cm away from the sensor|-60 degrees to the perpendicular axis of the sensor|Yes
    6|350 cm away from the sensor|0 degrees to the perpendicular axis of the sensor|No

4. Once the above points are complete, add a 16x2 LCD Display to Figure 1, and place
the image of the circuit completed up to this section.

5. When you have completed the integration of the I2C Display, adjust the program that allows you through the display display the following message, "Target detected to ? cm, and if you do not achieve detection indicate the message "Goal out of range"

7. ## Conclusions

>**Kathy Ramos:**
>The ultrasonic sensor is very useful, but it is important to know the ranges it handles for it to work properly. To observe its behavior and the results obtained there are tools such as the serial monitor of the Arduino IDE, but in this case we were able to appreciate everything more easily implemented the LCD monitor, which allows us to appreciate everything more easily.

>**Guillero Santos:**
>The ultrasonic sensor is a device commonly used in the industry for the detection of objects at a certain distance. It was very interesting the application of this sensor in this practice because we observed in the simulation how the sensor simulated an ultrasonic wave, which reached the target and returned it, this in order to detect it and measure the distance between the 2 objects. The use of the LCD display was of great help to indicate the distance between the object and the sensor.


>**David Becerra:**
>It is interesting how the ultrasonic sensor works, and how it calculates distance from ultrasonic waves. The ultrasonic sensor is a very useful device in robotics projects due to its simple operation.


>**Jose Aguilar:**
>In this practice we were able to see the ultrasonic function component with de TinkerCad simulator. The ultrasonic component has a range that can allow detect an object. The sensor sends a signal, which collides with the object and returns to the sensor. Thanks to the speed formula (V=D/T) we can obtain the distance at which the object is located.
